### Changed

### Removed

- iOS Support

It's way too expensive to publish on the iOS Store. It requires a MacOS machine,
which costs _at least_ 1 K$, which I don't have, and a developer license of 100$
/ years, which I'm not going to spend for an open source app.

You are free to fork this project and publish on the iOS Store according to the
GNU GPL v3.
